## About me

I've always been interested in programming and for years it has been a fun hobby. So in 2021 I thought: let's do it, let's become a professional dev !
And here I am, currently working my way toward professional front-end development.

I use HTML & CSS (Sass) on an daily basis...but what I love the most is JavaScript (TypeScript)

Feel free to explore some of my projects below :
